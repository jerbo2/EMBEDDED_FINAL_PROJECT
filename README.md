# EMBEDDED_FINAL_PROJECT
This repository holds the final Embedded Systems CCS project by Jeremy Beal, Cory Tindall, and Andrew Mazurek. The code uses three different functions to sample (through
polling) three different ADC channels. The data is trasmitted via UART and is picked up by the C# .NET framework program for upload to ThingSpeak. This also includes
an LCD header file as the data is sent to an LCD display (the code was modified but originated from here https://github.com/ticepd/msp430-examples). For a full breakdown of the the project, see the attached pdf report.
